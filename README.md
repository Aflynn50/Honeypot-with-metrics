# Honeypot-with-metrics
A honeypot framework designed to capture login information and IP addresses of attackers.
Location data of the attackers is show on a choropleth map diagram.
Todo: display usernames and passwords in a word cloud.
Currently has a honeypot login portal for ftp and telnet but is easily extensiable to other protocols.
It can also listen for connections on any port.
Data accessable through a http web server
Probably best to run in a virtual machine
